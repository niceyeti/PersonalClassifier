This is experimental code for a similarity-based personal identification program,
which has many uses in security, healthcare, and usability features.
The method relies on cosine-based word similarity matrices, generated from personnel
in the Enron dataset. Preliminary results are good. The methods are kludgy,
its really just the similarity metrics that are being demo'ed.

-TODO: add Enron resource data
-improve metrics
-more experiments to determine useful projections of similarity data
